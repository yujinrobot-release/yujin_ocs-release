%description
Virtual sensor that uses semantic map information to &quot;see&quot; obstacles
undetectable by robot sensors. Current implementation cannot read obstacles from
YAML files. Until this feature gets implemented, we use auxiliary scripts to
read and publish files' content. Data directory contains some example files.

# In case we're installing to a non-standard location, look for a setup.sh
# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
