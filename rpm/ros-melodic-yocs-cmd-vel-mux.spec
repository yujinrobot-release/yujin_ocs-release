%description
A multiplexer for command velocity inputs. Arbitrates incoming cmd_vel messages
from several topics, allowing one topic at a time to command the robot, based on
priorities. It also deallocates current allowed topic if no messages are
received after a configured timeout. All topics, together with their priority
and timeout are configured through a YAML file, that can be reload at runtime.

# In case we're installing to a non-standard location, look for a setup.sh
# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
