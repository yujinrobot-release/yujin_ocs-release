Description: Math toolkit for Yujin open control system.
 This package is intended to contain common use functions, mostly for simple mathematics but also for tf-related conversions. By no means it pretends to be an efficient and robust, widely used math library, but a play ground where to put common code that is typically repeated in many robot control programs.
